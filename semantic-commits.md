## Some of my most used semantic commits.

| Commit  | What does it mean? |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ✨ first commit  | As a first commit, I am always happy to show my new projects to the world. |
| ♻️ refactor:  | It means I have changed some classes or divs, repositioned some stuff or changed the code in general.  |
| 🎁 feat:  | A new feature for the user, like adding JavaScript or new Like buttons.  |
| 🩹 fix:  | Something was not working properly, so I've fixed it.  |
| 📄 docs:  | I was just updating the README or some other text files that are related to the code. |
| 🖌️ style:  | I was probably feeling something out of place about a color or font, and then I've changed it.  |
| 📚 study: | I'm not sure if this oficially exists, but I use this to upload my study notes.  |
| 💎 update: | I use this special semantic commit to update my profile README infos. |
